= Guiding principles for Automation Good Practices

As an overall guiding principle for designing good automation, the Zen of Python, by Tim Peters, serves as a good guidepost to follow. The principles defined in this are very applicable and can give guidance when the better practice is  unclear.

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

Examples::
Some example situations that can be pulled out from this include the use of 'ignore_errors'. Since Errors should neve pass silently, a better practice would be using conditionals and skipping irrelevant tasks.
Another example situation would be whether to use Fully Qualified Collection Names (FQCNs). Using these guiding principles, Explicit is better than implicit, so utilizing FQCNs is recommended.
